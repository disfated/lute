# Changelog

## 2023-09-22 v2.1.0

Various fixes for new user non-Docker installs:

* Windows users only: Add .env file variable `DB_WINDOWS_REPLACE_TRIPLE_SLASH=yes`.  If you're running Windows and get the error "SQLSTATE[HY000] [14] unable to open database file", try using this .env setting.
* Remove Japanese from new db demo data if user doesn't have MeCab (issue [69](https://github.com/jzohrab/lute/issues/69))


## 2023-09-17 v2.0.14

This release preserves the case of terms created from texts.  For example, clicking "Paris" in "Je suis Ã  Paris" now creates the term "Paris", instead of "paris".  You can edit the term to change the letter capitalization if needed (but you can't change the term itself -- see [the wiki](https://github.com/jzohrab/lute/wiki/Terms-cannot-be-changed-once-created) for notes).

Feature changes:

* Preserve case for terms when creating from texts (issue [63](https://github.com/jzohrab/lute/issues/63))
* Allow changing case of Term letters 
* Allow spaces in parent tags (hit Return after entering a parent)
* Fix text moving/shifting on hover/click

## 2023-08-28 v2.0.13

* Enter parents using tags
* Term detail pop-up (on reading page) modified to display data for multiple parents
* Sentence lookups return sentences for multiple parents

Back end changes:

* Remove `texttokens` table - big space savings

* Add a "Term Tag" listing page, to see tags and the jump to Terms assigned to them.
* Add Language deletion.

Back end changes:

* More acceptance/browser-level tests for project stability (book creation, tag listing)


## 2023-06-02 v2.0.3

This release adds a few small features, and gets rid of some old code and database fields.  Per the notes on the wiki about [upgrading Lute](https://github.com/jzohrab/lute/wiki/Upgrading-Lute), don't forget to backup your database prior to upgrading, _just in case_.  (I've run the upgrade several times on my machine.)

Feature changes:

* Allow period in terms (ref [issue 28](https://github.com/jzohrab/lute/issues/28))
* Only show sentences for texts I've actually read (ref [issue 34](https://github.com/jzohrab/lute/issues/34)).  The navigation buttons on text page footers set the "read date" for texts
* Show "Sentences" link even when defining new term, so that users can see where a new term has been used in the past.  Useful when defining new multi-word terms that they may have encountered already.

Back end:

* Add stack traces to error screens
* Add initial set of browser-level acceptance tests using Panther
* Add page number to page title
* Remove obsolete words table fields


## 2023-05-15 v2.0.2

* Remove dead code

* Fix license

Back end changes:

## 2023-04-17 v2.0.0

Big changes:  Moving from MySQL to Sqlite, and adding Docker support.

Back end (some very big changes, which simplified many sections of the code):

The changes forced some API changes which may break if your front-end Javascript is cached (in the term form of the reading pane).  Update the page a few times, and clear your javascript cache, and it should sort itself out. :-)
